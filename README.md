# solar_panel_number_calculation
# Python script for calculating the number of solar panels needed.
# This project provides a Python script to calculate the number of solar panels required to meet a household's energy needs.

# Features:
# Takes user input for average monthly energy consumption (kWh).
# Prompts for location (city and state) to estimate solar irradiance.
# Calculates the daily energy consumption.
# Estimates the required solar panel system size based on solar irradiance and daily consumption.
# Outputs the recommended number of solar panels.

# Future improvements:
# Integrate with APIs to fetch solar irradiance data automatically.
# Consider panel efficiency, tilt angle, and other factors for more accurate calculations.
# Develop a user-friendly interface (GUI or web app).

# Contributing:
# Contributions, bug reports, and feature requests are welcome!
# Let me know if you would like to add any specific details about your project to this description!
